This is an exercise tracker app meant to use Mongodb,postman, mongoose, context, express, node, and react.
It also practices authorization using bcrypt and jsonwebtokens, and a validator library.

This is largely a finished project however I would improve it by adding an edit button to each exercise as well as an refactor it so sets could be added individually (since not every single set is always the same).
I would also include the ability to have full workouts saved (i.e arm day, leg day). It could also use some nicer styling and maybe some transistions.
